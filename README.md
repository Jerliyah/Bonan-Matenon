# Bonan Matenon!
## An Esperanto widget to greet me in the mornings

### Idea Notes
- All text will be in Esperanto, but hover or focus will present a tooltip of the English translation
- It will show a greeting message, along with date, time, and weather
- Date and time can be collected purely but the weather will require an API
- Colors of the page will change depending on weather

### Future Improvements
- Audio
- There will be an image that relates to the weather forecase (practice with Inkscape)
- Create a toggle (or check viewing medium) so that the use has the option to view in 2D or 3D
